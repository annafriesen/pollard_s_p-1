\frametitle{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item RSA cryptosystem
\item published in 1977 at the MIT 
\item by Ron \textbf{R}ivest, Adi \textbf{S}hamir and Leonard \textbf{A}delman
\item algorithm is based on two pairs of keys
\begin{itemize}
\item first pair $(N,E)$ to encrypt data
\item second pair $(N,D)$ to decrypt the data 
\end{itemize}
\item $N$ is product of two large primes $p,q$ \\($\log(i) > 232, i = p,q$) 
\item $N$ cannot be factored by now (computationally intractable  for classical (non-quantum) computers)
\item using quantum computers, Shor's algorithm could factor $N$
\item RSA ist still used to encrypt (still secure)
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{
%\frametitle{Motivation}

\textbf{The RSA algorithm:}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item let $OI$ be the original integer to be encrypted
\item or transfer your text into an integer (e.\,g. number in alphabet)
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item choose two random primes $p,q$
\begin{itemize}
\item $ p \cdot q = N > OI $ and $ p \neq q $ and $ \mid p - q \mid $ not too small
\end{itemize}
\item choose $E$ ($E$ prime suffices all conditions)
\begin{itemize}
\item $ E \in \{n \in \mathbb{N} \mid 2 \nmid n \}$ and $ E \nmid N $ and $  E > (p-1) \cdot (q-1)$
\end{itemize}
\item choose $D$
\begin{itemize}
\item $ (E \cdot D) mod ((p-1) \cdot (q-1)) = 1$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
%
\textbf{How to use the pairs of keys:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $ OI \overrightarrow{\tiny{\text{encrypt}}} CI: CI = OI^E mod (N) $ \\[0.2cm] 
\item $ CI \overrightarrow{\tiny{\text{decrypt}}} OI: OI = CI^D mod (N) $ \\[0.2cm] 
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Trial Division}

\begin{itemize}
\item the simplest (and most simple-minded) prime factorization algorithm
\item assume $n$ is not prime, test for $2 \leq i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$ whether $i \mid n$
\item  works quite well, because most coposite numbers have small prime factors
\item inefficient if $n$ has large prime factors
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{efficient} algorithm has \textbf{polynomial} running time $f(\log_2(n))$, i.e. $f(\log_2(n))\;\in\;O((\log_2(n))^k) \text{ mit } k\ge 0$
\end{itemize}
\item modifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item choose $i \in \{k \in \mathbb{N} \mid 2\nmid k \}$
\item choose fixed bound B: find $i \leq B$ (often $B = 10^6$)
\item test primes $i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{r} \rfloor$ (sieve of Eratosthenes)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Sieve of Eratosthenes}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item named by the greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (3rd century BC)
\item invented the name \textit{sieve} for known algorithm
\item deterministic algorithm
\item creates list of primes that are smaller than or eqal to a given integer $r \ge 2$
\item running time $\log_2(r-1)\cdot (r-1)$ is \textit{exponentional}

\begin{itemize}
	\item devided into two groups

		\item special purpose algorithms
		\begin{itemize}

			\item e.g. Pollard (p-1) factorization method
			\item not dangerous to RSA (RSA uses large primes)
		\end{itemize}
		\item general purpose algorithms
		\begin{itemize}
			\item efficiency depends only on number being factored
			\item e.g. general number field sieve

\subsection{Pollard (p-1) factorization method}
%
\frame{
\frametitle{Pollard (p-1) factorization method}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item based on Fermat´s little theorem
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{theorem}[Fermat´s little theorem]
%
Let $p$ be prime ($p \in \mathbb{P}$) and $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $a<p$. Then it holds:
\[
p \in \mathbb{P} \;\Rightarrow\; a^{p} \; \equiv \; a \:(\text{mod}\, p)
\]
If additionally $a$ and $p$ have no common divisor, i.e. $\gcd(p,a)=1$, then it even holds:\par
%
\[
p \in \mathbb{P} \;\Rightarrow\; a^{p-1} \; \equiv \; 1 \:(\text{mod}\, p)
\]
%
\end{theorem}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item cannot be used as a primality test
\item $\Leftarrow$ does not hold
\end{itemize}
%
}

\frame{
%\frametitle{Pollard (p-1) factorization method}
%
\begin{itemize}
\item invented by John Pollard in 1974
\item is a derivative of the Pollard rho method
\item suitable for n that is $B$-smooth for $p-1$
\begin{itemize}
\item A smooth (or friable) number is an integer which factors completely into small prime numbers. For example, a 7-smooth number is a number whose prime factors are all at most 7.
\end{itemize}
\item uses that for any $a$ and $\forall p \in \mathbb{P} : a^{p-1} \,\equiv \, 1\:(\text{mod}\, n)$, i.e. $a^{p-1} -1 \,\equiv \, 0\:(\text{mod}\, n)$
\end{itemize}
%
algorithm of Pollard´s rho method:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item pick two random numbers: $x \:(\text{mod}\, n) \text{ and } y \:(\text{mod}\, n)$
\item If $x-y = 0 \:(\text{mod}\, n)$ we found a factor $gcd(x-y, n)$, else go to step 1

\textbf{Algorithm of the Pollard (p-1) factorization algorithm}
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Input: $n \ge 2$
\item choose $a$ with $1 \leq a \leq n-1$ and arbitrary $B \in \mathbb{N}$
\item $\forall q \in \mathbb{P}, q \leq B$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a := a^q \:(\text{mod}\, n)$
\item $p := gcd(a-1, n)$
\item if  $p \mid n$ break
\item else select new $a$ and go to step 3

%\subsection{general number filed sieve}
%
%\frame{
%\frametitle{general number field sieve}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item most efficient known algorithm aside from Shor´s algorithm
%\item is a generalization of special number field sieve (NFS)
%\item special NFS can only factor certain numbers
%\item running time is super-polynomial and subexponenetial
%\item like the quadratic sieve it also is based on an enhancement of Fermat´s difference of squares technique (introduced by Maurice Kraitchik in the 1920s)
%\begin{itemize}
%\item instead of finding $x$ and $y$ such that $x^2-y^2 = n$ it suffices to find $x$ and $y$ such that $x^2 \, \equiv \, y^2\:(\text{mod}\, n) $
%\end{itemize}
%\item algorithms with subexponential running time are very complex and will not be presented in detail in the paper
